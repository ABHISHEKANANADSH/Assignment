Here's what this code does:
It imports the necessary libraries from scikit-learn.
It loads your dataset (you should replace X and y with your actual data-loading code).
It splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
It creates a simple machine learning model (a Random Forest Classifier) and trains it on the training data.
It makes predictions on the test set and calculates the model's accuracy.
You can customize this code to fit your specific machine learning task, dataset, and model. Make sure to load your data and adjust the model parameters accordingly
