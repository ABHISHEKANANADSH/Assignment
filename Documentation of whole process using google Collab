I have used googlecollab online to implement the process coding process.
Here is the link of my basic models,libraries and explanation

copy past and open the link below-

explanation of code step by step
(Ony one model I have used ie Random Forest Classifier)



# Import necessary libraries
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load your dataset (replace with your data)
X, y = load_your_data_here()

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and train the model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Model accuracy: {accuracy}")
